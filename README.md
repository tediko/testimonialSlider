# Testimonial Slider

Hi! This is a simple and clear testimonial slider. Slider is responsive and has an infinite effect. For this purpose I used the cloneNode method, duplicating the first and the last slide. The slider slide without user input using the setInterval method, but it stops when user cursor is in the slider area. Moving between slides is done using controls (arrows) and indicators (dots).
